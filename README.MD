This is the master file for all the work we have completed in module 3 for Digital Crafts. Each project should be easily identifiable by their directory / file name. Due to the pace of the class and my own personal studies with react and Three.js once i understood the concepts being taught if we moved on from the assignment I moved on as well and continued with my personal studies. They will likely be incomplete during first review, but now that I am aware they will be reviewed they will be completed in time for next review! Thank you!
